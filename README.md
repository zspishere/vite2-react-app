This Repo is designed to reappearing the error as below, powered by vite2 and react-17 and [react-activation](https://github.com/CJY0208/react-activation).
I guess it's vite2's bug, because webpack is OK.

- `yarn dev` is ok

- `yarn build` and `yarn serve`, then we will got an error from Broswer Console when visiting `http://localhost:5000/`.
```
Error: Minified React error #130
```

I also have another two related issues, which could have more debug info.
